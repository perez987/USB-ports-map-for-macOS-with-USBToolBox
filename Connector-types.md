### USB Connector Types

**USB 3 Type A**

* Type 0. Standard USB 2 ports.

* Type 3. Standard USB 3 ports.

This was the first connector type designed. For the first two versions of the USB interface (1 and 2), this connector remained unchanged. It was in USB 3 that additional pins and the blue color were added.

**USB Type C**

There are three types of USB Type C connectors: USB 2 only, Type C with a switch, and Type C without a switch.

* USB Type C - Type 8. This is the USB 2 port within the USB C port.
* USB Type C (Type C + Switch) - with a switch is Type 9. Both USB 2 and USB 3 are connected to the USB C port, and a switch in the circuit allows the use of both by reversing the connector.

* USB Type-C (Type C - Switch): without a switch, it's Type 10. Both USB 2 and USB 3 connect to the USB-C port, as in the previous case, but by reversing the connector, different interfaces are used.

It's the most advanced of all and will eventually replace the other types; in fact, it's the USB 4.0 standard. USB Type-C first appeared with USB 3 and, therefore, doesn't have versions 2 and 1.
The European Union's legislative bodies are directing all future mobile device production towards the exclusive use of this type, initially to unify charging formats.

**Internal**

Type 255: Used for any internal device, such as Bluetooth chips, card readers, fingerprint scanners, webcams, etc.

**ExpressCard**

Type 2: This is the USB portion of ExpressCards.
